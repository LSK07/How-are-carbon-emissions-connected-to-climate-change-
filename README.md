Most people nowadays realize that the climate is changing due to global warming. 
It is a very serious problem these days due to pollution and temperature rise. 
However, did you know that global warming is related to carbon emissions, which is the starting point of the greenhouse effect? 
Let's discuss how global warming relates to carbon emissions and what carbon emissions are.
What is carbon emission? Carbon emission is the release of carbon into the atmosphere. 
To talk about carbon emissions is simply to talk of greenhouse gas emissions; the main contributors to climate change. 
Since greenhouse gas emissions are often calculated as carbon dioxide equivalents, they are often referred to as “carbon emissions” when discussing global warming or the greenhouse effect. 
Since the industrial revolution, the burning of fossil fuels has increased, which directly correlates to the increase of carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere and thus the rapid increase of global warming.

Then how is the carbon emission connected to climate change? 
The answer is pretty simple. Almost everything we need to live emits carbon. 
For example, carbon dioxide is emitted when we breathe, and tons of carbon are emitted every day in various places such as electricity, agriculture, logistics, transportation, burning fossil fuel, and product production. Originally, Earth radiates heat from sunlight into space. 
However, carbon accumulates in the atmosphere and forms a large film, which absorbs sunlight but blocks the heat from leaving the earth, so the temperature in the atmosphere gradually increases and the temperature of the ground rises accordingly.
So what will our future look like? 
Well... If carbon emissions continue to increase at this rate, the Earth's surface and atmosphere temperature will keep rising further, making it impossible for major living things to survive and many living things will disappear. 
It will no longer exist. What we can do to slow down this can start with small things such as recycling, using public transport, riding a bike, and saving water.
